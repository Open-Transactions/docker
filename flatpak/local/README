run-container.sh
    allows us to easily start the container locally and open command prompt
    mounts paths accordingly to local environment, so you will need to tune it based on your setup
    running it locally should result in:
    
    pgawron@DESKTOP-TJSC50O:/mnt/f/repo-matterfi/docker/flatpak/local$ ./run-container.sh
    [root@88ea0df7c389 script]# ll
    total 8
    -rwxrwxrwx 1 1000 1000 797 May 31 15:09 README
    -rwxrwxrwx 1 1000 1000 918 May 31 15:03 build-in-container.sh
    -rwxrwxrwx 1 1000 1000 348 May 31 15:11 run-container.sh

    now you should have access to build-flatpak.sh both from container and from host OS
    which is nice to be able to actively modify it and test

build-flatpak.sh
    performs flatpak build of wallet
